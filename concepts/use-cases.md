# Use Cases

Twine was originally developed to support the [CURBy project](https://random.colorado.edu), a hybrid quantum-classical randomness beacon. The applications of Twine go beyond the original scope, however. Twine is useful for generating a ledger of ordered events that can be verified to be authentic and unaltered and the time of creation can be verified in relation to third-party data. Twine is most useful when chains are entwined between independent parties, which increases the confidence that the timing of the records could not be tampered with unless all parties were colluding.

Some example use cases include:

* Logging of events
* Secure time-stamping
* Record of digital contracts
* Randomness generation
* Distributed computation
